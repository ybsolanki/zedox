# Discord Bot Deployment Guide

Your Discord bot is a full-stack application that includes:
- A Discord bot that needs to run continuously
- A React web dashboard
- PostgreSQL database integration

## ‚ùå Why Netlify Won't Work
Netlify is designed for static websites and serverless functions. Your Discord bot needs to:
- Maintain a persistent connection to Discord
- Run continuously 24/7
- Handle real-time events

## ‚úÖ Recommended Hosting Platforms

### 1. Railway (Recommended)
- Perfect for Discord bots
- Built-in PostgreSQL database
- Easy deployment from GitHub
- Free tier available

**Steps:**
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to railway.app
3. Create new project from GitHub repo
4. Add environment variables:
   - `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`: Your bot token
   - `NODE_ENV`: production
5. Railway will automatically detect and deploy

### 2. Render
- Good for Node.js applications
- Free PostgreSQL database
- Auto-deploy from GitHub

**Steps:**
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Go to render.com
3. Create "Web Service" from GitHub
4. Set build command: `npm run build`
5. Set start command: `npm start`
6. Add environment variables

### 3. Heroku
- Classic choice for Node.js apps
- Add-on PostgreSQL database
- Git-based deployment

## üîß Environment Variables Needed
```
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database
NODE_ENV=production
```

## üìÅ Local Development
1. Download the zip file from Replit
2. Extract and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

Your bot will run on the platform and be accessible 24/7!
